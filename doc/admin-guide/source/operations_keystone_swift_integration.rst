Keystone / Swift integration
============================

Introduction
------------

`Keystone <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/>`__ is an `Openstack <https://www.openstack.org/>`__ service that provides API client authentication,
service discovery, and distributed multi-tenant authorization by implementing
OpenStack?s Identity API.

`Swift <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/>`__ is Openstack object store.

OpenIO SDS implements the Swift API using the same proxy by replacing the
middleware by one implementing OpenIO SDS API. Used alongside Keystone, it allows administrators
to manage end-users access to the data using the Swift API or the S3 API (through the `Swift3 middleware <https://github.com/openstack/swift3>`__).

On the Openstack project website, you will find the full documentation about
`configuring and using Keystone <https://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/cli-manage-projects-users-and-roles.html>`__. However, it might appear complex to
administrators to link usage with the object store, this page will help you
understand and using the basics of both solutions used together.

Manage accounts
---------------

Accounts are created in Keystone and are then mapped into Swift. When accessing
to a Swift resource, the user authenticates against Keystone that handles
user authentication using a token that the user will need for each request to
Swift. Swift has an access to Keystone to allow or deny each request it receive.

In `Keystone API v2 <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v2/>`__,
you first to create a user, then give a role to that user in a tenant (aka
project). The default `domain <https://docs.openstack.org/newton/install-guide-obs/common/glossary.html#term-domain>`__
if *default*.

To create the first user, we will use the admin token defined in Keystone
configuration. Avoid using this credentials as possible. Get the admin token,
it is defined by the *admin_token* parameter in */etc/keystone/keystone.conf*.
Export it as *ADMIN_TOKEN* environment variable. Replace *controller* by the IP
address of your Keystone service::

  # export OS_TOKEN=$(awk '/^admin_token/ {print $3}' /etc/keystone/keystone.conf)
  # export OS_URL=http://controller:35357/v2.0
  # export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=2

Now, let's create an *admin* user, we will put him in the *admin* tenant/project
and give him the *admin* role. The *admin* role is a special role that gives a
user the ability to create entities in Keystone: user, projects, roles, etc.

::

  # openstack project create --description "Admin project" admin
  # openstack user create --password ADMIN_PASS admin
  # openstack role create admin
  # openstack role add --project admin --user admin admin

We can now unset previous environment variables and use the admin user we
created::

  # unset OS_TOKEN OS_URL OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION

For ease of use, create a *keystonerc_admin* file containing the admin user
credentials. Be careful with the file access rights::

  # echo 'export OS_TENANT_NAME=admin
  export OS_USERNAME=admin
  export OS_PASSWORD=ADMIN_PASS
  export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v2.0' >keystonerc_admin

Then source the file to be identified as *admin* user::

  # source keystonerc_admin

Using this account, let's create other standard account to use with Swift.
We start by creating a project *demo* in which we will add a *demo* user with a
*swiftoperator* role::

  # openstack project create demo
  # openstack user create demo --password DEMO_PASS
  # openstack role create swiftoperator
  # openstack role add --project demo --user demo swiftoperator

Now, identify as *demo* user, we start by creating a file to easily identify::

  # echo 'export OS_TENANT_NAME=demo
  export OS_USERNAME=demo
  export OS_PASSWORD=DEMO_PASS
  export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v2.0' >keystonerc_demo

Source the file, create a container and add a file in the freshly created
container, checking the information of the account, container and file, then
download the file pushed. Refer to `Openstack Swift command line documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/swift.html>`__
for more informations on how to use *swift* command line::

  # source keystonerc_demo
  # swift stat
  # swift post container1
  # swift stat container1
  # swift upload container1 /etc/magic
  # swift stat container1
  # swift stat container1 etc/magic
  # swift download container etc/magic

File is now at the *etc/magic* path, note that uploading the file trimmed out
the leading */*.


Default role *_member\_* has no rights to modify Swift containers. The
*swiftoperator* role can give access to *_member\_* users of the project or any
other user of any project using `ACLs <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_acl.html#keystone-auth-acl-elements>`__.

Let's create another user in the demo project as *admin*::

  # source keystone_admin
  # openstack user create demo2 --password DEMO2_PASS
  # openstack role create _member_
  # openstack role add --project demo --user demo2 _member_

Give the read and write right to *demo2* using ACLs as *demo* to our
*container1*::

  # source keystone_demo
  # swift post -r 'demo:demo2' -w 'demo:demo2' container1

Now let's create an autentication file *keystonerc_demo2*::

  # echo 'export OS_TENANT_NAME=demo
  export OS_USERNAME=demo2
  export OS_PASSWORD=DEMO2_PASS
  export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v2.0' >keystonerc_demo2

Source the file and access the object storage::

  # source keystonerc_demo2
  # swift stat container1
  # swift list container1
  # swift upload container1 myfile

Now let's share the container to anyone in read-only::

  # source keystonerc_demo
  # swift post -r '.r:*,.rlistings,demo:demo2' -w 'demo:demo2' container1

To give access to the container and object, you need to share the storage URL,
you can get it using the result of the following command::

  # swift auth

Public users can access the *etc/magic* object in the *container1* using the
*OS_STORAGE_URL* like::

  # curl -XGET http://controller:6007/v1.0/AUTH_6ff0afaaa43f4e2ba5a4f748b959fa7f/container1/etc/magic

Conclusion
----------

The key idea to understand is that Keystone manages accounts and let users
access a project resource in the Swift object store.

Projects can be shared to users of the necessary authorization role in a the
same project, and containers can be shared to users of any project or
publicly to anyone using ACLs.
